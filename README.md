# Cloud computing project 2025: VehicleTrack

This is a project meant to demonstrate the usage of several cloud-native technologies.
The indended product (intended, because several features remain unimplemented) is a multitenant web service for managing company vehicles.
Users can add and configure "external" (mock) vehicle connections to their fleet,
browse a real time overview of its status, send commands to vehicles like activating an immobilizer,
and manage geofences that can be configured to automatically send commands.

See [doc/README.md](doc/README.md) for high level documentation.
